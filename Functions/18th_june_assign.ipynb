By logging information about what your program is doing, you can get a better understanding of how it works and identify any areas that need to be improved. Additionally, logging can help you debug your code more effectively, because you can see exactly what is happening when a certain piece of code is executed.

    "The logging and print statements in Python serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Destination: The print statement writes output to the standard output (typically the console), while the logging module allows you to direct the output to various destinations, such as files, email, network sockets, or external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configurability: The print statement has limited configurability. It simply outputs the provided value(s) as-is. On the other hand, the logging module offers extensive configuration options, including log levels, output formats, log handlers, and filters. This allows you to control the verbosity, format, and destination of log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity: print statements are often used for immediate debugging purposes during development. They provide a quick way to inspect variable values or track program flow. However, they can be cumbersome to remove or disable once the debugging is complete. Logging, on the other hand, supports different log levels, allowing you to distinguish between different levels of severity and choose what information should be captured based on the execution context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintainability: print statements are typically scattered throughout the code and need to be manually removed or commented out after debugging. This makes the code less maintainable and can introduce clutter. Logging, when used properly, provides a more structured and maintainable approach to capturing and managing log messages. Log statements can be easily enabled or disabled, and their behavior can be controlled centrally."
