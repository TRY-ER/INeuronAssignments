    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class. Inheritance creates a parent-child relationship between classes, where the child class (also known as the derived class or subclass) inherits the properties and methods of the parent class (also known as the base class or superclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of inheritance is to promote code reuse and to create a hierarchical structure of classes. By inheriting from a base class, the derived class automatically gains access to its attributes and methods. This allows for the reuse of common functionalities and the extension of existing classes to add new behaviors or modify existing ones. Inheritance helps to organize and structure code, improves code readability and maintainability, and reduces code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance enables the concept of polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of the same base class. This allows for more flexible and modular code design, as different derived classes can be used interchangeably in various parts of the program."

    "In object-oriented programming, single inheritance and multiple inheritance are two different approaches to class inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance refers to the concept where a class inherits from only one base class. In other words, a derived class has only one immediate parent class. The derived class inherits the attributes and behaviors of the base class, allowing code reuse and extending the functionality of the base class. Single inheritance offers a simple and straightforward class hierarchy, making the code structure more manageable and less complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Simplicity: The class hierarchy is straightforward and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Code Reusability: Inheriting from a single base class allows the derived class to reuse the code and functionalities of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Encapsulation: Single inheritance promotes encapsulation, as the derived class inherits only the necessary attributes and behaviors from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance refers to the concept where a class can inherit from multiple base classes. In this approach, a derived class can inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple parent classes. This allows for combining functionalities from different classes into a single derived class. Multiple inheritance provides flexibility and allows for more complex class relationships and code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance enables the derived class to inherit and reuse code from multiple base classes, promoting code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Flexibility: Multiple inheritance allows for creating class hierarchies with more complex relationships and combining features from different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Modularity: Multiple inheritance allows for creating modular code by inheriting specific features from different classes, leading to a more flexible and modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Differences between Single Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Single inheritance allows a class to inherit from only one base class, while multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. In single inheritance, the class hierarchy is simpler and easier to manage, while multiple inheritance can lead to more complex class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Single inheritance promotes a more focused and specific relationship between classes, while multiple inheritance provides more flexibility in combining features from different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Single inheritance may be preferred when the relationship between classes is straightforward and doesn't require combining features from multiple classes, while multiple inheritance may be useful in cases where different classes contribute to the functionality of the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "v. It's important to note that both single inheritance and multiple inheritance have their own use cases and should be chosen based on the specific requirements and design considerations of the application."

    "\n",
    "A base class, also known as a parent class or superclass, is the class from which other classes inherit. It is the class that provides the common attributes and behaviors that are shared by its derived classes. The base class serves as a blueprint or template for the derived classes to inherit and extend. It defines the common functionality that can be reused by multiple derived classes. A base class can have its own attributes, methods, and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Derived Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "A derived class, also known as a child class or subclass, is a class that inherits attributes and behaviors from its base class. It extends or specializes the functionality provided by the base class by adding new attributes or overriding the existing methods. The derived class can have its own additional attributes, methods, and properties while inheriting the common features from the base class. It can also define its own unique behavior that is specific to the derived class.\n",
