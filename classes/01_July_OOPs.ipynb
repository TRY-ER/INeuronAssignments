    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, as well as in other programming languages, is to organize code and data into reusable components called objects. OOP aims to improve code modularity, reusability, and maintainability by providing a way to structure programs around objects that have their own data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concepts of OOP in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulating data and methods within objects, allowing for information hiding and better control over access and modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Allowing objects to inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes, promoting code reuse and creating hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably through the use of common interfaces, enabling flexibility and extensibility in program design.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these OOP principles, Python programs can be designed in a modular and structured manner, making it easier to manage complex systems, promote code reuse, and enhance code maintainability and scalability."

Class methods are defined with the @classmethod decorator and operate on the class itself rather than individual instances."
